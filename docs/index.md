## SQL 

```
-->What is SQL 

-- Structured query language (SQL) is a programming language for storing and 
processing information in a relational database. A relational database stores 
information in tabular form, with rows and columns representing different 
data attributes and the various relationships between the data values. 
You can use SQL statements to store, update, remove, search, and retrieve information from the database. 
You can also use SQL to maintain and optimize database performance.
